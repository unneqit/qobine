# Disconnect
This release brings a self-hostable Connect feature called "Disconnect". 

You can host the server yourself, or you can use my public at: https://qobine-disconnect.sofusconnect.addington.dk
Please don't abuse it 😄 

Currently only the RFID and the web projects are supported. Support for the TUI and the GTK players are coming.

## How to use:
When running the web or rfid project provide the following flags:
```
      --disconnect-device-name <DISCONNECT_DEVICE_NAME>
          Disconnect device name
      --disconnect-password <DISCONNECT_PASSWORD>
          Disconnect password
      --disconnect-server-url <DISCONNECT_SERVER_URL>
          Disconnect server url
```

eg: `qobuz-player-web --disconnect-device-name livingroom --disconnect-password very-secret --disconnect-server-url https://qobine-disconnect.sofusconnect.addington.dk`

Now when you open the web ui, you will be able to see a music note icon, where you can select all running clients (web or rfid) with the same password.

## Why not Qobuz connect?
Good question. 

The official Qobuz Connect protocol is undocumented, and generally not fun to develop against. 
The needed code for "Disconnect" is also required for Qobuz Connect to control, activate and deactivate a player (client). 

Qobuz Connect would also allow us to use the official smartphone app for controlling. 
I personally don't use the official app, so this is not compelling for me.
